"1","dead","Dead cell stains are membrane-impermeant dyes that are excluded by viable cells, but stain necrotic or late apoptotic cells with damaged plasma membranes.","https://www.tcd.ie/ttmi/facilities/fcf/assets/pdf/dead-cell-stains.pdf"
"2","proliferated","dye",""
"3","infected","Infection marker for HIPC Standard for specifying cell populations","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26833/"
"4","MHC:epitope","MHC:epitope staining for HIPC Standard for specifying cell populations","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitope"
"5","viable","In flow cytometry, live cells are distinguished from dead cells or debris by several measures.  The non-debris gate is often set on FSC vs SSC plot position. Propidium iodide and Annexin V are commonly used to detect apoptotic cells by their binding to cellular components that are intracellular in viable cells.","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexin_A5; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propidium_iodide"
"6","singlet","When Area Scaling is set properly, the value of A = H for a singlet event.","https://www.researchgate.net/post/How_does_FSC-A_vs_FSC-H_indicate_the_singlets_in_a_FACS_data"
"7","lymphocyte","A lymphocyte is a leukocyte commonly found in the blood and lymph that has the characteristics of a large nucleus, a neutral staining cytoplasm, and prominent heterochromatin. Lymphocyte gate is often set on FSC vs SSC plot position.","http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0000542"
"8","monocyte","Myeloid mononuclear recirculating leukocyte that can act as a precursor of tissue macrophages, osteoclasts and some populations of tissue dendritic cells.  Monocyte  gate is often set on FSC vs SSC plot position.","http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0000576"
"9","intact","Intact gate is often set on FSC vs SSC plot position.","https://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Intact"
"10","granulocyte","A leukocyte with abundant granules in the cytoplasm. Granulocye gate is often set on FSC vs SSC plot position.","http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0000094"
"11","SSC","The light scatter is measured by two optical detectors. One detector measures scatter along the path of the laser. This parameter is referred to as forward scatter (FSC). The other detector measures scatter at a ninety degree angle relative to the laser. This parameter is called side scatter (SSC). When measured in conjunction, these two measurements allow for some degree of cellular differentiation within a heterogeneous population.","https://www.flowjo.com/learn/flowjo-university/flowjo/getting-started-with-flowjo/58"
"12","leukocyte","A type of blood cell that is made in the bone marrow and found in the blood and lymph tissue. Leukocytes are part of the body's immune system. They help the body fight infection and other diseases. Types of leukocytes are granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils), monocytes, and lymphocytes (T cells and B cells). Checking the number of leukocytes in the blood is usually part of a complete blood cell (CBC) test. It may be used to look for conditions such as infection, inflammation, allergies, and leukemia. Also called WBC and white blood cell.","https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/leukocyte"

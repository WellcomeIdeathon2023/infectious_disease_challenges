Microarrays can be constructed by several methods including (but not limited to in situ oligo synthesis (e.g. Affymetrix), cDNA spotting, bead arrays (e.g. Illumina) and antibody spotting. The position and identity of probes are provided by the manufacturer. The probe identifiers and their target are referred to as annotation or translation of probe identifiers to bioinformatic identifiers. Microarrays can be used for gene expression (mRNA transcript quantification), genotyping, cytokine quantification, etc. Microarrays for gene expression fall into two general classes- single channel and dual channel. The channel refers to the wavelength scanned for fluorescent signals. Affymetrix microarrays are obligatory single channel.

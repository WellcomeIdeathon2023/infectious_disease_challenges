Furthermore, L-Cysteine and 2-ketobutyric acid can be biosynthesized from L-cystathionine; which is mediated by the enzyme cystathionine gamma-lyase. Furthermore, L-Cysteine and glycine can be biosynthesized from cysteinylglycine; which is catalyzed by the enzymes aminopeptidase N and caspase-7. Finally, L-Glutamic acid and L-cysteine can be converted into Gamma-glutamylcysteine through the action of the enzyme glutamate--cysteine ligase. In humans, L-cysteine is involved in the homocysteine degradation pathway, the glucose transporter defect (SGLT2) pathway, the cysteine metabolism pathway, and the metolazone action pathway. L-Cysteine is also involved in several metabolic disorders, some of which include the chlorothiazide action pathway, the triamterene action pathway, cystathionine Beta-synthase deficiency, and homocystinuria, cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency. L-Cysteine is a potentially toxic compound.","http://www.hmdb.ca/metabolites/HMDB0000574"

Within the cell, corticosterone is primarily located in the cytoplasm, membrane (predicted from logP), mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. Corticosterone participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, Corticosterone can be converted into 18-hydroxycorticosterone through its interaction with the enzyme cytochrome P450 11B1. In addition, Corticosterone can be biosynthesized from 11b-hydroxyprogesterone through its interaction with the enzyme steroid 21-hydroxylase. In humans, corticosterone is involved in the steroidogenesis pathway.

"628","HMDB0005066","Tetradecanoylcarnitine","Tetradecanoylcarnitine, also known as (R)-myristoylcarnitine, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as acyl carnitines. These are organic compounds containing a fatty acid with the carboxylic acid attached to carnitine through an ester bond. Thus, tetradecanoylcarnitine is considered to be a fatty ester lipid molecule. Tetradecanoylcarnitine is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Tetradecanoylcarnitine has been detected in multiple biofluids, such as saliva, urine, and blood. Within the cell, tetradecanoylcarnitine is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Tetradecanoylcarnitine exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans.

Within the cell, acetaminophen glucuronide is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Acetaminophen glucuronide participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, Acetaminophen glucuronide and uridine 5'-diphosphate can be biosynthesized from acetaminophen and uridine diphosphate glucuronic acid; which is mediated by the enzymes UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-9, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B15, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-1, and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-6. In addition, Acetaminophen glucuronide can be converted into acetaminophen glucuronide; which is catalyzed by the enzyme ATP-binding cassette sub-family g member 2. In humans, acetaminophen glucuronide is involved in the acetaminophen metabolism pathway.

Quinine is a drug which is used for the treatment of malaria and leg cramps. Quinine exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Quinine has been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, quinine is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Quinine participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, quinine can be biosynthesized from (8S)-cinchonan. Quinine can also be converted into 3-hydroxyquinine. Quinine has a bitter taste. Quinine is a potentially toxic compound.","http://www.hmdb.ca/metabolites/HMDB0014611"

In addition to carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen, alkaloids may also contain oxygen, sulfur and more rarely other elements such as chlorine, bromine, and phosphorus. Piperine exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Piperine has been detected in multiple biofluids, such as feces and blood.

Numerous disorders have been described that lead to disturbances in energy production and in intermediary metabolism in the organism which are characterized by the production and excretion of unusual acylcarnitines. A mutation in the gene coding for carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase or the OCTN2 transporter aetiologically causes a carnitine deficiency that results in poor intestinal absorption of dietary L-carnitine, its impaired reabsorption by the kidney and, consequently, in increased urinary loss of L-carnitine. Determination of the qualitative pattern of acylcarnitines can be of diagnostic and therapeutic importance. The betaine structure of carnitine requires special analytical procedures for recording. The ionic nature of L-carnitine causes a high water solubility which decreases with increasing chain length of the ester group in the acylcarnitines. Therefore, the distribution of L-carnitine and acylcarnitines in various organs is defined by their function and their physicochemical properties as well. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) permits screening for free and total carnitine, as well as complete quantitative acylcarnitine determination, including the long-chain acylcarnitine profile (PMID: 17508264, Monatshefte fuer Chemie (2005), 136(8), 1279-1291., Int J Mass Spectrom. 1999;188:39-52.).

"1271","HMDB0004160","Urobilin","Urobilin, also known as urochrome, is the tetrapyrrole chemical compound that is primarily responsible for the yellow color of urine. Urobilin is formed through the oxidation of its parent compound uroblinogen. Urobilin is actually generated through the degradation of heme, the red pigment in haemoglobin and red blood cells (RBCs). RBCs have a life span of about 120 days. When the RBCs have reached the end of their useful lifespan, the cells are engulfed by macrophages and their constituents recycled or disposed of.  Heme is broken down when the heme ring is opened by the enzyme known as heme oxygenase, which is found in the endoplasmic reticulum of the macrophages. The oxidation process produces the linear tetrapyrrole known as biliverdin along with ferric iron (Fe3+), and carbon monoxide (CO). In the next reaction, a second methylene group (located between rings III and IV of the porphyrin ring) is reduced by the enzyme known as biliverdin reductase, producing bilirubin. Bilirubin is significantly less extensively conjugated than biliverdin. This reduction causes a change in the color of the biliverdin molecule from blue-green (vert or verd for green) to yellow-red, which is the color of bilirubin (ruby or rubi for red). In plasma virtually all the bilirubin is tightly bound to plasma proteins, largely albumin, because it is only sparingly soluble in aqueous solutions at physiological pH. In the sinusoids unconjugated bilirubin dissociates from albumin, enters the liver cells across the cell membrane through non-ionic diffusion to the smooth endoplasmatic reticulum. In hepatocytes, bilirubin-UDP-glucuronyltransferase (bilirubin-UGT) adds 2 additional glucuronic acid molecules to bilirubin to produce the more water-soluble version of the molecule known as bilirubin diglucuronide. The bilirubin diglucuronide is transferred rapidly across the canalicular membrane into the bile canaliculi where it is then excreted as bile into the large intestine.  The bilirubin is further degraded (reduced) by microbes present in the large intestine to form a colorless product known as urobilinogen. Some of the urobilinogen produced by the gut bacteria is reabsorbed and re-enters the enterohepatic circulation. These urobilinogens are oxidized and converted to urobilin. The urobilin is processed through the kidneys and then excreted in the urine, which causes the yellowish color in urine. Many urine tests monitor the amount of urobilin in urine, as this provides some useful insight into urinary tract function. Normally, urine would appear as either light yellow or colorless. A lack of water intake, for example following sleep or dehydration, reduces the water content of urine, thereby concentrating urobilin and producing a darker color of urine. Obstructive jaundice reduces biliary bilirubin excretion, which is then excreted directly from the blood stream into the urine, giving a dark-colored urine. This dark colored urine has a paradoxically low urobilin concentration.","http://www.hmdb.ca/metabolites/HMDB0004160"

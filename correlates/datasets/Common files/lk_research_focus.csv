"2","Molecular Biology","The study of biology at a molecular level. It chiefly concerns itself with understanding the interactions between the various systems of a cell, including the interrelationship of DNA, RNA and protein synthesis and learning how these interactions are regulated. The field overlaps with other areas of biology, particularly genetics and biochemistry.","http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C16872"

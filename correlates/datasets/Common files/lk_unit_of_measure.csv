"78","NPX","NPX, Normalized Protein eXpression, is Olink's arbitrary unit which is in Log2 scale.  It is calculated from Ct values and data pre-processing (normalization) is performed to minimize both intra- and inter-assay variation. NPX data allows users to identify changes for individual protein levels across their sample set, and then use this data to establish protein signatures. The NPX scale is inverted compared to that of Ct. This means that a high NPX value equals a high protein concentration. Because NPX is in a log2 scale, a 1 NPX difference means a doubling of protein concentration. If needed NPX values can be converted into linear scale: 2^NPX= linear NPX.","https://www.olink.com/question/what-is-npx/","concentration"

# Notes on datasets

For this challenge you must use the datasets in this folder.
Please ensure you have read the Terms of Use before using any of the datasets.
The complexity of this challenge is in understanding which data to use and how it links together and we have given some hints below to help you.
We are *not* expecting you to generate novel results from these datasets but to demonstrate how you would integrate datasets from the same study (SDY296 and SDY301) with datasets from different studies (SDY180) and how you would provide functionality including visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning.
Your prototype also does not need to show realistic analyses, we are interested in the functionality and its potential; not the results.

**Common files**

* Description: These files provide metadata that may be used by any of the three studies listed below, for example values for mapping variables between numeric codes and their actual values (e.g., [lk_race.csv](https://github.com/WellcomeIdeathon2023/infectious_disease_challenges/blob/main/correlates/datasets/Common%20files/lk_race.csv) shows the mappings between codes (1-9) and race).

**SDY180**

* Study title: Systems scale interactive exploration reveals quantitative and qualitative differences in response to 2009-2010 Fluzone influenza vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine
* Study description: Systems approach to study immune response to seasonal influenza and 23-valent pneumoccocal vaccination in healthy adults.

**SDY296**

* Study title: Systems Biology Approach to Analysis of 2011-12 TIV Fluzone Influenza Vaccine Response in Healthy Individuals (see companion study SDY301)
* Study description: This project will contribute to the overall vision and goals of this U19 by analyzing the immune response to Flu vaccination in healthy individuals. The knowledge generated in this Project will be transferred to Projects 3-5 where immune effects of vaccination will be studied in patients with underlying immune system alterations.

**SDY301**

* Study title: 	Systems Biology Approach to Analysis of 2012-13 TIV Fluzone Influenza Vaccine Response in Healthy Individuals (see companion study SDY296)
* Study description: This project will contribute to the overall vision and goals of this U19 by analyzing the immune response to Flu vaccination in healthy individuals. The knowledge generated in this Project will be transferred to Projects 3-5 where immune effects of vaccination will be studied in patients with underlying immune system alterations.
